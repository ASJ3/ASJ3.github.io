        <p>Dear Customer,</p> 
        <p>I am excited to tell you that we have made some updates to the Avendra brand and the messaging around our services. Given the changes and investments Avendra has made over the last few years, we revised our communication strategy to re-introduce to you and also to highlight what sets us apart and better focus on the value we bring to you, our customers. As a result, you may notice some modifications in our marketing and communication materials (such as customer newsletters, Avendra.com, advertising, etc.).</p>
        <p><b>We acquired BuyEfficient, a leading eProcurement software company</b></p>
	      <p><b>Avendra's CEO</b><p>
        <p>When he worked with LSG, Schaefer was responsible for the Americas procurement team. “It was the first time that I was really involved in the food supply chain. Later, I became responsible also for the whole menu design group.”</p>
        <p>Stepping away from tourism, Schaefer served as COO for NCH Corporation’s European division. The company manufactures and distributes maintenance chemicals and industrial parts to engineers and construction sites. There, Schaefer was responsible for the whole production, and had to make sure he got the right product to the right people at the right time to make sure machines kept working.</p>
        <p>The education he received at LSG and NCH proved vital for Schaefer’s success at Avendra, a company he joined in 2010 as COO. He became president and CEO four years later. In those previous roles, he learned a key lesson for success in any industry: “It’s very important to be customer-centric and really responsive to the needs in the marketplace,” he said. </p>
