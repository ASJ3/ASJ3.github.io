        <p>Dear Customer,</p> 
        <p>I am excited to tell you that we have made some updates to the Avendra brand and the messaging around our services. Given the changes and investments Avendra has made over the last few years, we revised our communication strategy to re-introduce to you and also to highlight what sets us apart and better focus on the value we bring to you, our customers. As a result, you may notice some modifications in our marketing and communication materials (such as customer newsletters, Avendra.com, advertising, etc.).</p>
        <p><b>We acquired BuyEfficient, a leading eProcurement software company</b></p>
